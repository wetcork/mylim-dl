This script can download in PDF format all the books (+ all extra contents) from [myLIM](https://mylim.loescher.it/).

The need for this script stems from the fact that in most cases the official school ebook services lack care and functionality. The problem can be solved at the root by distributing the books in PDF format, so that each person can then use the PDF reader of their choice with the functionality they need.

This script does not want to encourage piracy, but we paid for books, but books that work.
This script in no way bypasses the limitations already present in the original service and only allows you to download books purchased and activated in your account.
## Using this script

This is a guided command line script so that also who isn't practical can use it.

To start simply run ```mylim-dl.py``` and follow the istructions.

Please note that this script can only download books purchased and activated in your account.
To activate a book visit [myLIM official site](https://mylim.loescher.it/).
